h2. cidr2mask.sh

A bash function for converting CIDR number to a netmask. I used this to make a more "user friendly" configuration for vpnc.

h2. classfinder.rb

Searches for a given class in the libraries connected to a maven project in eclipse. Useful for finding which libraries are defining conflicting classes. Which seems to happen a lot if you use java web services.

h2. runbackup.rb

The script that I use to backup matschaffer.com. It's very barebones and currently only supports backup of a folder and mysql database to sftp (as is the case on Dreamhost). To use it, make a configuration file called "wordpress.backup" and put it next to a file called "wordpress" and put something like this in it:

  mysql :host => 'mysql.yourdomain.com',
        :user => 'yourmysqluser', :password => 'yourmysqlpassword',
        :database => 'yourmysqldatabase'
  sftp  :host => 'backup.dreamhost.com', :user => 'yourbackupuser', :folder => 'backups'
  keep  10

Then run it with: ruby runbackup.rb /path/to/config

Each of these is just a function call on the Backup object which defines the commands that will be run during the backup. The backup process is defined by the "start" method.
